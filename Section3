Lecture 1:
User registration and user profiles
--we will need to build a view to allow visitors to create a user account.

---we include only the username, first_name, and email fields of the model. These
fields will be validated based on their corresponding model fields

For example, if the user chooses a username that already exists,
they will get a validation error because username is a field defined with
unique=True.

--You can provide a clean_<fieldname>() method to any of your
form fields in order to clean the value or raise form validation
errors for a specific field
--Forms also include a general clean()
method to validate the entire form, which is useful to validate fields
that depend on each other.

--open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/register/ to checkout the register
then register and click create account

--Click on the log in link and enter your username and password to
verify that you can access your account.
