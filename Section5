Lecture 1:
Creating an image bookmarking website
1. Define a model to store images and their information
2. Create a form and a view to handle image uploads
3. Build a system for users to be able to post images they find
on external websites

--create a new app called images

--django-admin startapp images
--we then build the image model

NB:
Database indexes improve query performance. Consider setting db_index=True
for fields that you frequently query using filter(), exclude(), or order_by().
ForeignKey fields or fields with unique=True imply the creation of an index. You can
also use Meta.index_together to create indexes for multiple fields.

Lecture 2: 
Creating many-to-many relationships:
--run the migrations for images
--to apply migrations --python manage.py migrate images

Lecture 3:
Registering the image model in the administration site
edit the admin.py file and register image
